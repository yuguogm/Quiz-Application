# CPSC 210 Project

## Quiz Maker

Throughout my academic career, using active recall techniques such as flashcards and quizzes have greatly
benefited my ability to understand and retain what I learned. However,
this would often result in stacks of flashcards and pages upon pages of notes before every exam.
Therefore, I wanted to design my own **quiz application** that allows for me to review for tests
without having to spend so much time and resources towards making the review material.
It will be geared towards *students like me* who find themselves spending a lot of time and paper to
review, instead allowing for them to study for their tests **digitally**. *As long as they have their
computer with them*, they will be able to create, and review their notes at any time.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I would add a new class that manages the navigation and display of the questions as MyQuiz should only 
represent a quiz containing questions and answers.
- I would also create a class that checks the user's answer because that should not be the responsibility of
the MyQuiz class.
- I would also split up my QuestionAndAnswer class into a question class and answer class.
